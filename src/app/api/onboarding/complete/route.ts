        // We assume the user is authenticated at this point? 
        // Or we pass the restaurantId/userId from the previous step?
        // Since we redirected to a page, we should rely on Session ideally.
        // However, for simplicity/consistency with the current registration flow which might not have fully established session cookie yet?
        // Actually, `verify` didn't set a session cookie explicitly in the code I saw (NextAuth usually mimics session).
        // If NextAuth isn't setting session on that custom verify, we might need to rely on the user logging in or passing a token.
        // BUT, the plan is to redirect immediately.
        // If `verify` just updates DB, the user is NOT logged in yet in NextAuth sense unless `verify` does `signIn`.
        // The user will probably need to Login after verify? Or we auto-login?
        // The prompt says "Aprés l'activation on lui demander...".
        // If the user is not logged in, we can't secure this endpoint easily without a token.
        // I will assume for this "fast" flow that we might need to pass `restaurantId`?
        // Or better, let's assume the frontend will ask the user to login first? No, that breaks flow.
        // I'll assume we can pass the `userId` or `restaurantId` if we securely return it or set a cookie.
        // Wait, the `verify` route returns `ok: true`. It does NOT return a token.
        // And `RegisterPage` redirects to `/onboarding/complete-profile`.
        // It doesn't pass state.
        // If the user isn't logged in, they can't save this info to *their* restaurant.

        // ADJUSTMENT: The `verify` logic should ideally log the user in.
        // Since I can't easily change NextAuth logic to auto-login without credentials,
        // I will make `/onboarding/complete-profile` require a `restaurantId` query param or similar?
        // That's insecure (anyone can update anyone's profile if they guess ID).
        // Better Approach:
        // 1. `register/verify` returns a temporary `onboardingToken`?
        // 2. OR `RegisterPage` invokes `signIn` with the PIN immediately after verify?
        // YES. Auto-login with the PIN we just set!

        // I'll update the `RegisterPage` to `signIn` after verify.
        // But for now, let's write this route to expect an Authenticated session.
